    <h1 class = "centeredtext">INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p class = "centeredtext">We have asked a question, and we need to answer it. Luckily for us, I have already solved the question! Since I have solved the question ("How have Hindu practices changed over time?"), I will tell you the answer.</p>
    <h1 class = "centeredtext">THE ANSWER</h1>
    <p class = "centeredtext">First, I will be noting that Hindu practices have changed in a lot of ways over time, so I will only be listing a few of them, because if I listed all of them, This webpage would be too long to read.</p>
    <p class = "centeredtext">Less injuries (Because when the Aryan civilization started thousands of years ago, people had to stop eating for weeks and hang themselves upside down for long periods of time. But nowadays, people normally pray and celebrate Hindu-related holidays (Holi, Diwali, etcetera))</li>
    <br>
    <p class = "centeredtext">Holidays (In the ancient times, the Hindu holidays weren't fun and joyful, but now, you can have fun during the holidays!)</li>
    <br>
    <p class = "centeredtext">More popular (Ancient times: Only a few tribes/civilizations practiced Hinduism. Sort-of-Modern Times: Popular troughout India. Present-day: Widespread throughout the world, almost bring more popular than Christianity!)</li>
