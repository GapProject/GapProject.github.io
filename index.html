    <h2 class = "centeredtext">THE INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p class = "centeredtext">We have asked a question ("How have Hindu practices changed over time?"), but we need to answer it. In this webpage, we will learn about the Hindu religion (also known as Hinduism), Hindu practices, and how it has changed over time.</p>
    <h2 class = "centeredtext">BREAKING DOWN THE QUESTION</h2>
    <p class = "centeredtext">In order to answer this question, we need to understand what it means. In order to do this, we need to break this into different parts first. The question "How have Hindu practices changed over time?" can be broken down to "How", "Hindu practices", and "changed over time".</p>
    <h2 class = "centeredtext">FUN FACT</h2>
    <p class = "centeredtext">Fun Fact: Hinduism is the oldest religion that is still believed in today.</p>
    <h2 class = "centeredtext">COMPREHENDING THE QUESTION</h2>
    <p class = "centeredtext">Now that we have broke down our question into different sections, we need to comprehend it! The word/phrase "How" is defined as "in what way or manner; by what means." according to a Google search. The next word/phrase is "Hindu practices", which probably means anything a person does (practices) relating to the religion Hinduism. This is the noun the earlier word/phrase "How" was describing. Finally, the last word/phrase is "changed over time", which probably references to in the question "Hindu practices". So we take "Hindu practices have changed over time" which is a statement, and put "How" before it (and of course putting "have" after the "How", because of grammar, but you can see how we can interpret this.)</p>
