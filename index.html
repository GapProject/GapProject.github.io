    <h2 class = "centeredtext">INTERPRETING THE QUESTION</h2>
    <p class = "centeredtext">We know what the question is, but we can't solve it without understanding what it means!<br>The question says "How have Hindu practices changed over time?", and we need to interpret what it means, so let's get started!<br>The question "How have Hindu practices changed over time?" can be rephrased so that we can understand it.<br>An example of this is "How have festivals/traditions related to the religion Hinduism changed over a time period which start is the beginning of Hinduism and end is present-day May 15th, 2018?" which states the question much better so we can get a lot of information out of the question.</p>
